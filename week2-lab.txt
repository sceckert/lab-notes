## Week 2: Lab
Pandoc and Marcdown
9/17/2014

- NB: For next week — see different readings. Think about Sontag and the distinction between *content* and *form*
- NB: The trajectory of the course: exposure to many different types of tools so that we can be the ones making decisions about how we choose and use our tools and that theses tools have POLITICAL and PHENOMENOLOGICAL implications.
How we “enframe” the world shapes how we think, how we retrieve and remember things. 

How texts work in our daily lives - > often takes on a managerial dimension. 
How we organize our information is directly and materially related to how we publish, circulate, and consume knowledge. 
	-These superstructural problems have their roots in the base problems.
	-Neo-marxists talking about the production of knowledge tend to talk about this in an abstract way. 
We need to visualize the material conditions of this trajectory of how knowledge travels(a la tracing out the line of cotton that Marx does in Capital) and is produced. 

Texts and Documents:
	We tend to think of documents as points and things.
	INSTEAD: we should think of these documents as VECTORS, a line with a direction
		- ex: A document travels in space and time (on a truck, online, etc)
		+———————>
		- allows us to think about indeterminacy of a document; the presence of many versions: how do you know when it’s finished? 
		- ex: email, paper, e-books, etc (all are vectors with certain types of affordances)
			- how do you store them? back them up? share them?
			- each knowledge org. choice pushes you into an ecosystem 
			- Each ecosystem has unique affordances (like encryption). 
		- One of the problems: third parties (often proprietary) are in charge of these encryption 
				- how might we map out every piece of text we see every day and how was it produced
		- Solution: take control of the origin point of each vector and unify them
			- Versus GoogleDrive or proprietary server that attempt to totalizes access, storage, search, etc 
			- Underneath somewhere there is an opportunity to keep it in plaintext file. 
				- Everything: email, blog posts, papers — unified in plaintext, is easy to vectorize!
			- We should look into any of these decisions as “a political founding moment” (Winner). ~ to making a law. 
		- Under this view, we build in plaintext
			- the other proprietary formats become vectors for publication, distribution,etc (say for a journal, a blog publication, etc).

// How deep do we go?
Definition of computer (From Turing): a machine that can emulate any other machine.
	- an abstract machine — that is, there is a level that floats above the computer. (the universal machine layer where even plain text is encoded in binary, but this is floating at the abstract level of the universal machine)
	- for this class: we stop at the level of hardware
		- Evan Moglin (important in the open software movement, at Columbia) insisted on ownership of the hardware.
		- suggests we own the materials — BUT this requires levels of education not normally accessible.
		- We don’t normally bother with the level of hardware but this has fraught politics

US Espionage Act:
	- encryption is listed as a military technology
	- the history of the technology is fraught w/ military tech.
	- Turing’s Enigma project in post WWII Cold War cypher
 
Minimal Computing: 
	- the politics of computing in developing world contexts where power is not a given.
		- what does information mean in this context? Much more limited, need for flexible formats

Form and content
	- fraught — just content or just form is impossible

=================
Lab
	- Separate Form and Content.
		- For the purposes of the operating system, separating form and content can give you certain affordances
	- WYSIWYG: “What You See Is What You Get”
		- Writing in Microsoft Word, where the two are collapsed
		- Consequence: we write and format at the same time
		- Because the formatting happens at the same time, we actually end up reinforcing something where what you see is NOT what’s underneath (because Microsoft Word must insert its own language in between your plaintext underneath)
		- You the writer perform the job of typesetter —> this is a big inefficiency! (also, typesetting is a huge outsourcing market)
	- You don’t know where your text will end up
		 — > Why are we so tied to the idea of the “printed page” when we interact with lots of different forms? 
		 — > Yet, writing in WYSIWYG affects the way we think about writing, so we have dual-pane

	- HTML: a layout engine, preferable to Microsoft Word because it is human readable. 
		- NB: Microsoft Word tried to answer this distinction in the change from .doc to .docx
			- attempted to write in XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language)
				- separate the text into marked up objects (tags and classes).
				- NB: this is a finite language. We only identify things that are important to you. 
		- HTML is a semantic structure.
			- separation of form and content (HTML and CSS)
			- we identify paragraphs, emphasis, links —> let the browser or stylesheet determine what the semantic object looks like
			- pro: liquid resolution and is responsive
			- con: still very gunky
	- NB: there is a distinction between FORM, CONTENT and FORMATTING 
		- form vs. formatting; this is the distinction between emphasis <em> and italics <i>
		- Why don’t we have tags that are called emphasis, direct speech, block quote 

	- Better: SEMANTICS, STYLE, CONTENT
	
	- Answer: Markdown
		- language developed to answer this problem of semantics, style and content without the “gunkiness” of HTML.
	
	- HTML decided by a governing body—W3
		- Microsoft, Google, involved
	- History of Markdown:
		- [“Daring Fireball”](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Aaron Schwartz was one of original inventors 
		- Now: reddit, Wikipedia
